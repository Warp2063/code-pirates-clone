# Destructuring

```js
const tim = {
  name: "Timothy",
  age: 28,
  location: "Costessey",
  favouriteFood: "Pizza"
}

// destructuring
const { location } = tim;
```

Now we have a variable called `tim` that we can access, but also a variable called `location` which has the value of the location property of tim.
